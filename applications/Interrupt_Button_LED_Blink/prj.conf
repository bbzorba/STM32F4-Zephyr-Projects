# Keep the CPU sleeping while idle.
#
# Note: On some STM32 setups, enabling CONFIG_PM/CONFIG_PM_DEVICE can select
# deeper low-power states where GPIO wake/LED control becomes unreliable
# without additional board-specific wake configuration.
# Tickless idle still allows WFI sleep without periodic SysTick wakeups.
